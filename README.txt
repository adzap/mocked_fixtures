== DESCRIPTION:

Yes, lets laugh at those silly fixtures with their silly yaml or comma 
separated values! Ha ha ha! Don't they know how passe they are. All the cool kids
are mocking and stubbing. Get with the times fixtures!

Well actually fixtures still have their place. Especially with the foxy fixtures
extensions added to Rails 2.0, they are now much easier to use. Problem is the 
undesirable database overhead that comes with reloading your fixtures for every 
test. Also, in controller and view tests, the database layer is unnecessary and 
using mock objects for test isolation is often preferred.

This poses another challenge of the often tedious creation those mocks to return
the values you need for tests much like you did for your fixtures. But what if 
you could reuse those fixtures as mocks where you don't need real ActiveRecord 
objects. Well thats where mocked_fixtures comes in.

This plugin helps by allowing you use your fixtures as disconnected mock objects
which never touch the database when loaded or used. So you can now keep using 
those thoughtfully crafted fixtures in your controller and view tests but minus
the database overhead.

A mocked fixture is a mock model object with all the model attributes stubbed
out to return the values from the fixture if defined. If no fixture value was 
defined then a nil is returned for the attribute method as you would expect.
There are no attribute setters defined on the object as they are left for you 
to do as necessary.

The attributes for each model are read from the schema.rb file to avoid any 
database access at all!

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

 * Reuse your fixtures as mock model objects without database overhead
 * Adds feature to supported mocking libraries to quickly create empty mocked
   model with all attributes methods stubbed out. Supported are Rspec, flexmock
   and mocha.
 * Same familiar style of using regular fixtures
 * Works with popular testing frameworks such as Rspec (with rspec-rails),
   shoulda and any testing library which uses good old test/unit as its base.

What it doesn't do:

 * Touch the database. This means that the fixtures are not inserted in the 
   tables, thats not what the plugin is for.
 * Create mock objects with the attribute setters. Only reader methods.


Disclaimer:
It is worth noting that the plugin is highly coupled to the Rails fixtures 
implementation and so would likely break with future changes to the fixtures API.

== SYNOPSIS:

To get going you installed as a gem you need to require the plugin at the top
of your test_helper or spec_helper file. If you installed as a Rails plugin then
you can skip that step.

If you are using test/unit then you need specify which mocking library you 
are using in your test_helper like so:

  class Test::Unit::TestCase
    
    # can be one of :flexmock or :mocha
    self.mock_fixtures_with :flexmock  
  end
  
If you are using Rspec you need to set it in the configure block:

  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
    
    # can be one of :rspec, :flexmock or :mocha
    config.mock_fixtures_with :rspec
  end

If you are using something other than the supported libraries then you get an 
error alerting the plugin can't be used with that library. You can then write you own
interface to the plugin for that library if you want. See the files in 
lib/mocked_fixtures/mocks and the spec for mock fixture objects in spec/mock_factory_spec.rb.
  
On to the good stuff. Now if you have a Company model and fixture for the model
like this

  megacorp:
    name: Mega Corporation
    moto: Do Evil

Just like normal fixtures you declare which ones you want to use in your test
or spec at the top

  class MyTest < Test::Unit:TestCase
	  mock_fixtures :companies

	  def setup
		  @company = mock_companies(:megacorp)		  
	  end
	  
	  def test_does_something
	    assert_equal @company.moto, 'Do Evil'
	  end
  end
  
All the attributes will be stubbed to return the values from the fixture. The 
fixture is generated using the internal Rails fixtures class, so any of fixture
tricks, such as association labels and automatically generated ids, will work.

If you want more than one fixture, then like normal fixtures you list the 
fixture keys to get back an array of the objects.

  @companies = mock_companies(:megacorp, :bigstuff)


To quickly grab all of the fixtures you call use the :all option

  @companies = mock_companies(:all)


Like regular fixtures you can also declare global mock fixtures to pre-load for all
your tests. Because the mock fixtures don't access the database it doesn't slow down
the running of tests like global fixtures can.

To setup global mock fixtures, in your test_helper put:

  class Test::Unit::TestCase
    
    self.global_mock_fixtures = :companies
  end
  
If you are using Rspec you need to set it in the configure block:

  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
    
    config.global_mock_fixtures = :companies
  end

You can also set the global to :all and all fixtures will be loaded as mocks. This
can add some test startup time if you have a lot of fixtures but shouldn't slow 
down your tests when running at all. Might use a bit of memory though.

Thats all for now, so mock on!


NOTE:
If you use MS SQL Server then you need to apply a fix for this adapter to 
correctly dump primary keys when not named 'id'. Just drop this line in an 
initializer file

  require 'mocked_fixtures/connection_adapters/sqlserver_adapter'

You then need to do a dump. Um, keep your pants on, I mean a database dump with
  
  rake db:schema:dump

Now the schema.rb file should be complete.
